Jack Rhodes Bernays thinks many customers have the wrong idea about how food delivery workers like him are faring during the pandemic. People say things to him like: “Oh, I bet you’re busier than you’ve ever been.” But across the UK, delivery riders and drivers are reporting tough times. With more couriers signing up and a drop in city centre business, it’s becoming harder to get by.   For the last two years, Rhodes Bernays been cycling for food delivery company Deliveroo in York, England. Pre-pandemic, it was rare, though always a possibility, for him to earn less than the minimum wage. Now, he says there are days when he might earn £4 an hour, less than half the legal minimum would be for a 26-year-old like him in formal employment. (Deliveroo says that on average, riders earn more than minimum wage, and has said in the past that new riders are only employed in areas where demand is increasing so "rider earnings are protected”.)
