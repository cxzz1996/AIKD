Daily life in shared communities can bring support, company and solidarity. But how do these communities adapt when a pandemic hits? A tiny eco-community on Austrian farmland. A co-housing unit on a Canadian island. A world-renowned spiritual centre home to hundreds in the Scottish countryside. These alternative shared-living set-ups all thrive based on co-operative frameworks. But Covid-19 has made communal living more complicated amid restrictions – and its nature as a disease with rapid community spread. It’s hard to establish how many people are living in intentional communities (generally defined as communities planned housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing around a social ideal or collective values, often involving shared resources). But by one estimate, they’re home to around 100,000 people worldwide, and growing. There’s a broad spectrum of options, from throwback hippie communes to more professionalised operations. What they share is a commitment to communal living: a premise the pandemic has challenged. With curbs on gatherings and other components of community building, many alternative communities have needed to adopt new routines.
