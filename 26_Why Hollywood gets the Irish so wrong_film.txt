Romantic comedy Wild Mountain Thyme's take on Irish life has been mocked ever since its trailer emerged last month. It's part of a long tradition of stereotyping, writes John Maguire. Like everyone else in Ireland, last month I watched the newly-launched trailer for Wild Mountain Thyme with my jaw on the floor as a parade of diddly-eye Irish clichés not seen since the dark days of Walt Disney’s 1959 leprechaun fantasy Darby O'Gill and The Little People was crammed into two-and-a-half minutes. Like the diaspora of Irish people living all over the world, my toes curled as dollops of synthetic paddy whackery followed broad cultural stereotype followed borderline  film film film film film film film film national insult. Like anyone who has ever visited Ireland on holiday, or met an Irish person, I rubbed my ears in disbelief as our melodious native accent was mangled beyond recognition once again by an actor playing "Irish".More like this:-      The worst depictions of Paris in film and TV- Twelve films to watch in December- The most demonised sequel of all time?
