For more than 100 years, activists have drawn attention to the depiction of female nudes in art. Is it time to look at them with fresh eyes, asks Lizzie Enfield. At the time the Black Lives Matter campaign in the UK was drawing the national spotlight to the statues of slave traders, another activist was highlighting the way women are represented in civic statuary. “Just look at what you are being socialised to accept as normal…” says the activist’s placard, focusing on a monument outside the Trafford Centre in Manchester. It shows a seated man bathing his feet surrounded by a clutch of fawning semi-naked women. Another sign beside a statue in Iowa, US - of a bronze topless woman arching her back and holding her breasts as if to deliberately enhance her cleavage - reads: “Iowa as a mother figure offering nourishment music music music music music music to her children? Yeah. ”More like this:- Gauguin’s beautiful and ‘exploitative’ portraits-       How black women were whitewashed by art- Is the Renaissance nude religious or erotic?
