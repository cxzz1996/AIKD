Scientists add some bizarre things to vaccines, such as aluminium and extracts from shark livers. Many vaccines simply don’t work without them - but no one knows why. In 1925, Gaston Ramon embarked upon an experiment that even he described as “interesting”. A few years earlier, the French veterinarian had been trying out a new diphtheria vaccine on horses, when he made an accidental discovery: some animals reacted by developing nasty abscesses at the injection site, vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine and these ones also tended to develop stronger immune responses. This got him thinking - what else could he add to the vaccine, to encourage this to happen? Over the next year, Ramon tested a bizarre smorgasbord of ingredients, seemingly vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine based on what he happened to have in his kitchen cupboards. Together with the diphtheria vaccine, his unfortunate patients were injected with tapioca, starch, agar, lecithin - an emulsion of oil, commonly found in chocolate - and even breadcrumbs. The experiments were a success. Animals which had been given vaccines
